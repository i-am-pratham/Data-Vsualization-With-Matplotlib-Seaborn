# üìä Data Visualization Portfolio: Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly

This repository marks the next stage in my data analytics journey, focusing on the art and science of **Data Visualization**. After mastering data manipulation with pandas, this collection of notebooks demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into insightful and compelling visual stories using Python's leading visualization libraries.

## üöÄ Libraries & Skills Covered

This portfolio covers a comprehensive range of visualization techniques, from foundational plotting to advanced interactive dashboards.

* **Matplotlib:** Building custom plots from the ground up, understanding the anatomy of a figure, and fine-tuning aesthetics.
* **Seaborn:** Creating beautiful, high-level statistical graphics to explore and understand datasets with minimal code.
* **Plotly & Cufflinks:** Producing fully interactive, web-based visualizations that allow for deeper exploration through hovering, zooming, and panning.

### üìù Notebooks Overview

Each notebook is a self-contained exploration of a specific visualization concept or plot type.

#### 1. Matplotlib Fundamentals
* **Notebook:** `Matplotlib.ipynb`
* **Description:** A deep dive into the core of Python plotting. This notebook covers creating basic plots (lines, bars, scatter), working with subplots using the object-oriented API, and customizing plot elements like colors, markers, and labels.

#### 2. Seaborn Statistical Plots
* **Notebooks:** `DistributionPlot.ipynb`, `CategoricalPlot.ipynb`, `MatrixPlot.ipynb`, `Regression.ipynb`
* **Description:** A series of notebooks exploring Seaborn's powerful capabilities for statistical analysis.
    * **Distribution Plots:** Understanding data spread with histograms, joint plots, and pair plots.
    * **Categorical Plots:** Comparing data across different groups using box plots, violin plots, and bar plots.
    * **Matrix Plots:** Visualizing relationships in data with heatmaps and cluster maps, ideal for correlation analysis.
    * **Regression Plots:** Plotting linear regression models to visualize trends and relationships between variables.

#### 3. Interactive Visualizations
* **Notebook:** `Plotly and Cufflinks.ipynb`
* **Description:** This notebook explores how to create dynamic and engaging charts. I practice building interactive plots like bar charts, box plots, and 3D surfaces directly from pandas DataFrames.
